    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I use data to drive everything I do. I translate user insights into product improvements and guide product growth, business development, and user engagement at SaaS startups. My work has focused in markets like productivity software, nonprofit technology and cause marketing. I'm happiest when I'm part of a company with a social mission (developing a scalable, sustainable business is quite nice, too).</p>
